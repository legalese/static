	  <h4 div class ="profiles-tldr">TL;DR</h4>
	    <p align="left">Meng is the computer scientist, systems architect, and
	      resident good cop at Legalese.  He enjoys specialising,
	      writing, and doing deep research. 20 years ago, he
	      created and led an anti-spam standard to worldwide
	      adoption (used in most emails today). He's purportedly a
	      lot wiser and more experienced now, so he wants to do the same and bring
	      L4 to worldwide adoption. Hopefully this time it'll take less than 15 years.</p><br>
   
	    <h4 div class ="profiles-tldr">Long Version</h4>
	  <p align="left"><b>Emails &amp; first startup</b><br>
	    In 1995, as a CS undergrad at the University of
		  Pennsylvania, Meng co-founded <a class="a-link"
		  href="http://pobox.com"
		  target="_blank">pobox.com</a>, the first commercial
		  email service (later acquired by Fastmail). A
		  couple of years later, to get over a breakup, he
		  created an anti-spam email standard
		  (<a class="a-link"
		  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework"
		  target="_blank">RFC4408 SPF</a>) and led it
		  to <b>global adoption</b>. Meng was also the one who championed its
		  adoption by Microsoft &amp; Google.
		    <b>Today, SPF protects a majority of all email.</b>
		    Not one for bragging, he suggests the curious
		    to read the<a class="a-link"
		    href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/02/AR2005070201360.html"
		    target="_blank">Washington Post's</a> piece on it instead.<br><br>
		    
		    <b>2nd Startup</b><br>
		    In 2005, Meng
		    co-founded <a class="a-link"
		    href="http://karmasphere.com"
		    target="_blank">karmasphere.com</a>, one of
		    the <b>first big data analytics solutions</b> to
		    deliver internet-scale “reputation data as a
		    service”. This evolved to offer Big Data tools and
		    was acquired by FICO.<br><br>

		    <b>Singapore &amp; the 3rd Startup</b><br> In
		    2008, Meng returned home to Singapore (after 20
		    years away) for personal reasons.  He missed the
		    Valley, of course, so he decided build a new
		    one. First, he co-founded <b>Hackerspace.SG</b>,
		    one of the first maker spaces in Singapore. Then,
		    bonding over <em>I'm OK, You're OK</em> (after
		    all, he did come from a family of psychiatrists)
		    with his soon-to-be cofounder, Hugh Mason, they
		    founded <b>JFDI.Asia, Singapore's first seed
		    accelerator</b>. The amount of legal and
		    quasi-legal documentation Meng had to deal with
		    (not successfully) at JFDI led Meng to put on his
		    programmer hat for a couple of days and hack
		    together what would later become v1 of Legalese.
		    <br><br>
		    Meng's background in innovation is informed by
		    Everett Rogers, Geoffrey Moore, Clayton
		    Christensen, William Janeway, Mariana Mazzucato,
		    and Simon Wardley; by sitting on a variety of
		    government panels in Singapore, most recently on
		    the Committee for the Future Economy's
		    subcommittee on Future Corporate Capabilities and
		    Innovation (Startups); and by investing in over 70
		    startups. He hopes his experience with Legalese
		    and doing a deep tech startup in Singapore will
		    answer some of the questions he's had to keep
		    answering (these include "<em>why can't we house
		    the next unicorn?</em>", "<em>why is our R&amp;D not
		    yielding the results we expected?</em>"). Some others,
		    like "<em>are you batman?</em>", he'll never
		    answer. <br><br>

	    <p>As cofounder of Legalese, Alexis's job description is
	      very vague. Anything that's not done but ought to have
	      been, is her job. As the recovering lawyer, Alexis also spends her day
	      exorcising legal demons and unlearning her bad
	      habits by sharing her understanding of the end-users, industry,
	      and established conventions and practices (i.e. horror stories) with the
	      engineering and product teams. She is known to sometimes style herself as
	      Alexis N. Chun in the well-honed tradition of Iain M. Banks.</p><br>

	      <h4 div class ="profiles-tldr">Long Version</h4>
	      <p>Alexis spends her day exorcising legal demons and
	      unlearning her bad habits. Mostly, she tries to get
	      things off the research team's plates so they can focus
	      on the VIP stuff. That can be anything from writing
	      about and for Legalese, pitching to anyone who'd listen,
	      convincing governments and organisations to give us
	      research money, answer product / industry questions,
	      community managing, to putting her natural assets
	      (<a class="a-link"
	      href="http://www.lmfgtfy.com/?q=rbf">RBF</a>) to good
	      use and playing bad cop to Meng's good cop within the
	      company. A little more self-interestedly, she also does
	      it so she won't have to wait too long to become the
	      first L4 legal programmer.<br><br>

		In her previous life, she first got <a class="footnote">lulled by the
giant payout of being a corporate lawyer<span>(she trained in corporate law
at TSMP Law Corporation, a boutique Singaporean law firm that boasted
of its highest starting salary)</span></a>, before moving onto a '<em>Big 4</em>'
experience with Rajah &amp; Tann where she continued her training and later
practised as an IP, IT, and commercial litigator. <a class="footnote">(Customary thank yous are footnoted here)<span>To <b> TSMP</b>, she is
grateful for the character building and for having imbued her with a
love of elegant drafting.<br><br> To <b>Rajah &amp; Tann</b>, she is grateful for the
wide scope of work, secondment opportunities (BNP Paribas;&nbsp;
JPMorgan), and for having always fed her like French royalty.</span></a>
Fortunately, none of the profession's razzle dazzle was enough to disabuse her of her mounting
suspicions that <b>the legal profession has neither the tools, math,
nor systems needed to solve its problems</b>. Her then-covert
explorations in the tech industry led her to OKCupid, which eventually
led her to Meng. Long story short: &nbsp; They met, he proposed, and 1 month later
she quit her job. (Actually, he only formally proposed 3 months after,
to which she might have reacted with a mild aneurysm and let a fumey fart escape whilst fully personifying the "???" thought bubble)<br><br>
		
Alexis unschooled herself for secondary school in Singapore
(preferring instead to hole up in her bedroom discovering music,
films, and books), and is a proud alumna of Victoria Junior College. She's grateful that you read this far, but is
deeply apologetic for having wasted your time. She recommends that you
read any other section of the website instead (she put a lot of work into that). Or even
better, read Diamond Age. When she grows up, she'd rather like to be a
monster mash of Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Lyra Silvertongue, Ursula K Le Guin, Nell, Karen Teoh, and Amanda
Palmer</a>.</p>

	  <p>Dustin is a computer scientist with a <b>three peat
	  background in Computer Science</b> (BSc, MSc, and PhD)!
	  Essentially, this means that he spends a great deal of time
	  formalizing law and its associated appurtenances, sanity
	  checking the other computer scientists (and computer
	  scientist wannabes) in the team, and exercising his
	  sainthood-worthy patience with the rest of us who waste his
	    time with (silly) little questions and (trivial) demands (sorry Dustin!)</p>
	   <p>Prior to Legalese, he founded <a class="a-link"
	   href="http://dustinwehr.github.io/logic-for-progress/"
	   target="_blank">Logic for Progress</a>, a non-profit that
	   aims to advance the quality of deliberation on contentious
	   social issues. (We know, big man with a big heart to match
	  &mdash; we got lucky with this one!) Logic for Progress
	   has its genesis in <a class="a-link"
	   href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~wehr/thesis/index.html"
	   target="_blank">Dustin's PhD thesis</a> (which was completed under the
	   supervision of Stephen Cook and Alasdair Urquhart). He
	   advocates leveraging the high standards of formal deductive
	   logic (which are much higher than the standards of applied
	   statistics and philosophy) to cut through the noise to find
	   fundamental sources of disagreement, <em>whilst</em> avoiding flawed
	   reductionist mathematical modelling (as is usually found in
	   economics or game theory). It's a wee bit of a shame that he's had to put that on the back
	   burner for now ("<b>the world is not yet ready for this,
	       not in this form</b>", he says).

	   <p>He has an old, old, old (his words) <a class="a-link"
	   href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~wehr/"
	   target="_blank">personal website</a> where you can check
	   out more of his work. He currently lives in Toronto, but
	   has on occassion been coaxed out of Canada to attend
	   conferences and meetings with the rest of the team.</p>

	  <p>The self-taught web developer at Legalese who is super relieved that he gets to deal with code and computers instead of having to actually become a lawyer (he'd met Alexis and her horror stories worked wonders on him). Law school was boring enough.</p><br> 
	      <h4 div class ="profiles-tldr">Long Version</h4>
	      <p>Yes, it's from that book and person in the bible. His
		parents are religious; he no longer is.<br><br>
		The <a class="footnote">self-taught web
	      developer<span>though to be fair, he did attend a GA webdev course, but in his words, found it completely useless and preferred reading on his own instead</span></a>at Legalese deals with the practical side of
	      Legalese's product. This includes front-end work,
	      deployment, and all the other needs of a modern web
	      application. After studying four years of law, he
	      decided that the subject had turned his brain into mush,
	      and thus is now rehabilitating himself with the more
		energetic environs of programming. But for Alexis's proclaimation that he is "too smart to be a real lawyer", he might have been peer and family pressured into Big Law. Boy, did he dodge one.<br><br>
		Job has one of the
	      most enviable memory capacities of the team, is
	      always first pick at trivia games, and a very avid reader. Somehow, he still manages to find time to
	      play and watch DOTA 2, enjoy movies, and develop an
	      opinion on music. He is occassionally (affectionately) teased
	      for being from the <a class="a-link"
	      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifted_Education_Programme_(Singapore)"
	      target="_blank">Gifted Education Programme</a> (where
	      kids scoring amongst the top 1% of tested IQ are
	      recruited for special education) because he's often 3 steps ahead of everyone and doesn't like writing documentation. He comforts the rest of us by
	      pointing out that Meng was in it when it was designed for those in the top 0.25%, and if Meng can learn to write documentation and wait for the rest of us, so can he.<br><br>

		    <p>Virgil currently works as a Research Scientist at the Ethereum Foundation.<br><br>

		      Virgil is a cognitive and data scientist,
disruptive technologist, information and machine intelligence
theorist, and self-taught software engineer. In 2007, Virgil created
WikiScanner, a publicly searchable database that exposed organisations
which had made edits to Wikipedia’s entries by cross-referencing IP
addresses with a database of IP address owners. The year after,
together with Aaron Swartz, designed the Tor2web proxy, a web
anonymity tool that allows Tor hidden services to be accessed from
standard web browsers without being connected to the Tor network.
Virgil is also an accomplished theoretical neurobiologist in
quantifying consciousness.  He has published papers on computer
science, electronic identities, artificial life and complexity and
information theory [http://arxiv.org/a/griffith_v_1.html]. Virgil
received the Computational Graduate Fellowship from the US Government
(their highest fellowship) to complete studies at the Stanford
Graphics Laboratory and MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. He has
also dissected a Chinese censorship program at Harvard Law School.
Virgil holds a Ph.D. in Computation and Neural Systems from the
California Institute of Technology.
