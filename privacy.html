	  <p>Effective <b>10 January 2018</b> <br>Last modified on <b>10 January 2018</b></p><br>
<!-- TODO: insert link for archived versions of the privacy policy -->

<h2>Hello! We are so chuffed to have you with us.</h2>
	 <p>This <a class="footnote">Privacy Policy<span>that is, the
	 whole body of this document you are reading right now, as may
	 be amended from time to time</span></a> applies to our website, web
	 applications, platform, services, community / developer
	 resources, and products as provided at <a class="a-link"
	 href="https://legalese.com" target="blank">legalese.com</a>
	 (each a "<b>Product</b>", and collectively, the
	 “<b>Products</b>”).</p>

   	  <p>There are many ways that you can use our Products.<br>
          We understand and appreciate that when you use our Products
          you may share information with us. Sharing your information
          may help us make our Products even better –– for instance,
          to show you more relevant search results, to show you more
          appropriate smart defaults, to make sharing with others
          quicker and easier, etc. 
	  <p>That said, your privacy and preferences are important to us. So whether you are new to us
	  or a long-time user, <a class="a-link"
	  href="mailto:support@legalese.com?subject=Uhm, about your
	  Privacy Policy&CC=clause@legalese.com">please feel free to
	  reach out</a> should you have any questions.</p><br>


	  <h2>First things first</h2>
    <h3>Read this with the terms of use</h3>
      <p>This Privacy Policy complements
      our <a class="a-link" href="terms.html" target="_blank">Terms of
      Use</a>. This means they are to be read together. We urge you to
	also familiarise yourself with both of them and all other documents that they may reference.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand what
          information we collect, how we might use it, and what choices
          you have with regard such information. </p>
          <p><b>By using our Product(s), you consent to the collection
          and use of information by us as set out in
              this Privacy Policy.</b></p>
      
    <h3>Navigating this document</h3>
    <p><a class="footnote">Highlighted text like this (go on, you
      can hover over)<span>Good job, you hovered over something.</span></a>
       display further information when hovered over
      (they're a bit like footnotes), all of which are incorporated as
      part of this Privacy Policy.</p>
   <p> Capitalised terms not otherwise defined under
      this Privacy Policy will bear the same meaning
      as that ascribed to them under the <a class="a-link"
      href="terms.html" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> (as may be
      amended from time to time).</p>

<br>	  
<h2>Information that we collect</h2>
 <p>We collect information in a bid to better understand our Products
   and users (like you) so that we may then provide better Products
   and user experiences.</p>
 
<p>We collect the following kind of information:</p>
	  <ul>
	   <li> <b>Information you give us</b><br>
        <p>This could be <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That
        is, data that personally identifies a single person in
        question (in this case, you). For instance, your name, email
        address, or credit card details.</span></a> or non-personal
        information. You may be asked to provide such information anytime you are in
        contact with Legalese or using any of the Products. We may
        then share such information and use it in a way that is consistent
        with this Privacy Policy. Here are some examples of such information
        that we may collect and how we might use them:
		<ul><li>For example (but not by way of limitation),
        our Products may require you to sign up for an account with us
        in order to unlock or use certain features or
        functionalities. When you do sign up for an account, we’ll ask
        for <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is, data that
        personally identifies a single person in question (in this
        case, you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit
        card details.</span></a> such as your contact details, address, and name to store with your
        account. </li>
	<li>For example (but not by way of limitation), we may use <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That
        is, data that personally identifies a single person in
        question (in this case, you). For instance, your name, email
        address, or credit card details.</span></a> of
        your family, friends, associates, or such other relevant
        persons as you may elect and inform us of, in order for us to fulfill your requests and
        instructions (such as, the sending out of generated documents,
        reminder emails, prompts, etc) or for anti-fraud
          purposes.</li>
	<li>For example (but not by way of limitation), we may use
        <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is, data that
        personally identifies a single person in question (in this
        case, you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit
        card details</span></a> that you give us (including date of
        birth) to verify identity, assist with the identification of
        users, and to determine appropriate services.</li>
	<li>For example (but not by way of limitation), we may from
        time to time use your <a class="footnote">Personal
        Data<span>That is, data that personally identifies a single
        person in question (in this case, you). For instance, your
        name, email address, or credit card details.</span></a> to
        send important notices (such as communications about purchases
        and changes to our Terms of Use, conditions, and
          policies.</li>
	<li>For example (but not by way of limitation), we may use
        <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is, data that
        personally identifies a single person in question (in this
        case, you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit
        card details</span></a> for internal purposes such as
        auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our Products
        and customer communications and understanding.</li>
	<br>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    
	    <li><b>Information we get from your use of
	    Products</b><br>We
	    collect <a class="footnote">information about the Products that you use and how you use them<span>This includes
	    information like your data usage, preferences, selection,
	    interaction with our Products, browsing history, searches,
	    documents, and other content hosted by us or on our
	    behalf. This may also include any content as it flows
	    through out system.</span></a>. We have systems set up to
	    analyse and process such information as they are sent, received, and
	    when they are stored. Such information is classified as
	    non-personal information as it is collected in a form that
	    does not, on its own, permit direct association with any
	    specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and
	    disclose such non-personal information for any
	    purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal
	    information that we collect and how we may use it:
<br>
        <ul><li><a class="footnote">device information<span><b>device
        information</b> means information that is specific to the
        device you used to access the Product(s). For example:&nbsp
        your hardware model, operating system version, unique device
        identifiers, and mobile network information (including phone
        number). We may associate your device identifiers or phone
        number with your account with us. And <b>a device</b> is a
        piece of technological equipment that can be used to access
        any of our Products, including a desktop computer, tablet, or
        smartphone. </span></a></li>
        <li><a class="footnote">log information<span><b>log
        information</b> means information that is automatically
        collected and stored in server logs when you use our Products
        or view content provided by us. This may include details of
        how you used our Products, internet protocol address, device
        event information (e.g. crashes, system activity, hardware
        settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of
        your usage), cookies that may uniquely identify your browser
        or your account.<br><br>

        On <b>"server logs"</b><br> Like most websites, our servers
        automatically record the page requests made when you visit our
        sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request,
        Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the
        date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may
        uniquely identify your browser.</span></a></li>

        <li><a class="footnote">location information<span><b>location
        information</b> means information that we may collect and
        process about your actual location when you use our
        Products. This helps us better provide the Products and/or the
        features therein contained. We may use different technologies
        to determine your location, including IP address and GPS
        information.</span></a></li>
        <li><a class="footnote">information in local
        storage<span><b>information in local storage</b> means
        information (including personal data) that we may collect and
        store locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser
        web storage (including HTML5) and application data caches (an
        application data cache is a data repository on a device; it
        can, for example, enable a web application to run without an
        Internet connection and improve the performance of the
        application by enabling faster loading of
        content).</span></a>; and</li>
        <li><a class="footnote">information from cookies & similar
        technologies<span><b>information from cookies & similar
        technologies</b> means information we may obtain from various
        technologies we may use to identify the browser or device
        which you used to visit or use a Product of ours. Such
        information may also include information that we collect and
        store when you interact with our Product(s), including
        situations where you interact with Products we offer our
        partners.</span></a>.</li></ul></li></ul>

<br>	  <h2>How we use information that we collect</h2>
    <p>If you do not want us to use your information in any of the
    way(s) described in this Privacy
    Policy, please <a class="a-link" href="mailto:support@legalese.com">let us
    know immediately</a>.</p>
 
	  <p>We use the information that we collect so that we can
	  provide the Products to you and enhance your experience of
	  the Products. We may also personalize your repeat visits in
	  a bid to make the process more seamless and tailored to your
	  needs. We may use your <a class="footnote">Personal
	  Data<span>That is, data that personally identifies the
	  person in question (in this case, you). For instance, your
	  name, email address, or credit card details.</span></a> to
	  contact you and, if you agree, to enable our affiliates or
	  partners to contact you.

	    <ul><li>For example (but not by way of limitation), we may
	    contact you to give you notices about your account, site
	    updates, new services and features or to fulfil the
		purpose of a Product feature.</li></ul></p></p></li></ul>

    <h3>According to your account preferences</h3>
    <p>Information you post or share on or via our Products may be
    shared with others according to the account preferences associated
    with that particular account. By default, this would be the
    default account preferences settings when you first created an
    account with us. These account preferences may be updated by you
    at a later time under your personal or company settings options;
    they may also be set by administrator(s) of any linked accounts of
    yours. Your profile may be visible to others in accordance with
    these settings. We cannot guarantee the security of any
    information you publicly disclose online; this means that you must
    make any such disclosures at your own risk.</p>

    <h3>Non-personal information and/or anonymous data</h3>
	  <p>We may use non-personal information and/or anonymous data collected from you or your use of the
	  Products for site administration, analytics, advertising and
	  promotional purposes, and we may share such information with
	  other entities (such as service providers) for such
	  purposes. We may also aggregate data to enable research or
	  analysis so that we can better understand and serve you and
	  others. <ul><li>For example (but not by way of limitation), we may
	  conduct research on your demographics and usage. Although
	  this aggregated data may be based in part
	  on <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is, data that
	   identifies a single person in question (in this case,
	  you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit card
	  details.</span></a>, it does not identify you
	  personally.</p></ul></li>
	  <p>We may share this type of anonymous data with others,
	  including service providers, our affiliates, agents and
	  current and prospective business partners. We may use your
	  anonymous data outside of Legalese to improve third party
	  marketing or use your data in combination with third party
	  data to improve your experiences both in and outside
	  Legalese. We may retain your IP address and/or other
	  device-identifying data in order to help us diagnose
	  problems with our servers, to administer our Products
	  including personalizing content or links relevant to your
	  geographic area or device-type, to verify that your account
	  is not being used by others, to gather broad anonymous
	  demographic data (such as the number of visitors from a
	  geographic area), to enforce compliance with
	  our <a class="a-link" href="terms.html"
	  target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> or otherwise in order to
	  protect our Products, users, customers, or such other third
	  parties.</p>
	  <p>We may use analysis tools such as Google Analytics. These provide us with information about how our users use the Products.</p>

	  <br>
	  <h2>Control you have over our use</h2>
	  <p>You may delete your account at any time – this will remove your account page from our Product(s). We do not guarantee the ability to delete all stored data.</p>
    <p>If you would like us to
    delete/correct <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is,
    data that personally identifies the person in question (in this
    case, you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit card
    details.</span></a>, let us know and we will act on your request
    as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
    <p>Your account information will be protected by a password for
    your privacy and security. You have the responsibility of
    preventing unauthorized access to your account and personal data
    by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and
    limiting access to your computer or device and by signing off
    after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
	  <p>You can access information associated with your account by logging into your account with us.</p>

	  <br>
	  <h2>Sharing your data with third parties</h2>
	  <p>We may share anonymouse data with third parties to, for
	  example (but not by way of limitation), improve Legalese,
	  the Products, and to enable data aggregation as described
	  above.</p>
	  <p>Where necessary, we may share
	  your <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is, data
	  that personally identifies a single person in question (in this
	  case, you). For instance, your name, email address, or
	  credit card details.</span></a>, with our independent
	  contractors, subcontractors, service providers, or
	  affiliates (in each case, subject to confidentiality
	  obligations).</p>
	  <p>We may also share <a class="footnote">Personal
	  Data<span>That is, data that personally identifies a single
	  person in question (in this case, you). For instance, your
	  name, email address, or credit card details.</span></a> with
	  interested parties in the event that we anticipate a change
	  in control or the acquisition of all or part of our business
	  or assets or with interested parties in connection with the
	  use or rights in respect of our technology.</p>
	  <p>If Legalese is sold or makes a sale or transfer, we may,
	  in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your
	  personal data to a third party as part of or in connection
	  with that transaction. Upon such transfer, the privacy
	  policy of the acquiring entity may govern the further use of
	  your personal data. In all other situations your data will
	  still remain protected in accordance with
	  this <a class="footnote">Privacy Policy<span>that is, the
	  whole body of this document you are reading right now, as
	  may be amended from time to time</span></a>.</p>
<p>We may share your <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is,
	  data that personally identifies a single person in question
	  (in this case, you). For instance, your name, email address,
	  or credit card details.</span></a> at any time if required
	  for legal reasons or in order to enforce
	  our <a class="a-link" href="terms.html"
	  target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> or
	  this <a class="footnote">Privacy Policy<span>that is, the
	  whole body of this document you are reading right now, as
	  may be amended from time to time</span></a>.</p>

<br>
	  <h2>How we protect your data</h2>
	  <p>We care a great deal about keeping your data secure and
	  protecting it from inappropriate disclosure. This is why we
	  implement a variety of security measures to ensure the
	  security of your <a class="footnote">Personal
	  Data <span>That is, data that personally identifies a single
	  person in question (in this case, you). For instance, your
	  name, email address, or credit card details.</span></a>on
	  our systems. Any <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That
	  is, data that personally identifies a single person in
	  question (in this case, you). For instance, your name, email
	  address, or credit card details.</span></a> collected by us
	  is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible
	  by a limited number of Legalese personnel who have special
	  access rights to such
	  systems. Where <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That
	  is, data that personally identifies a single person in
	  question (in this case, you). For instance, your name, email
	  address, or credit card details.</span></a> is collected by
	  us, it will be transmitted and protected via a secure
	  protocol and encrypted in our databases to be accessed only
	  as stated above. If and when we use subcontractors or
	  service providers to store your data, we will not relinquish
	  control of your <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That
	  is, data that personally identifies the person in question
	  (in this case, you). For instance, your name, email address,
	  or credit card details.</span></a> or expose it to security
	  risks that would not have arisen had the data remained in
	  our possession.</p>
    <p><b>However, no transmission of data over the internet is
    guaranteed to be completely secure.</b> It may be possible for
    third parties not under our control to intercept or access
    transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we
    strive to protect your <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That
    is, data that personally identifies the person in question (in
    this case, you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit
    card details.</span></a>, we cannot ensure or warrant the security
    of any <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is, data that
    personally identifies the person in question (in this case,
    you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit card
    details.</span></a> you transmit to us. Any such transmission is
    done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with
    us is no longer secure, please <a class="a-link"

	    actions, determine whether you are logged in or not, or
	    enable you to see the electronic programme guide tailored
	    to your chosen provider/region.</li>
	    <li><b>Performance cookies</b> – These cookies improve the
	    performance of our Products. These cookies collect
	    information about how visitors use our Products, for
	    instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if
	    visitors get error messages from web pages. These cookies
	    don’t identify you personally. All information these
	    cookies collect is aggregated and anonymous. These cookies
	    enable us to manage errors and the performance and design
	    of the Products, to track ad response rates and your
	    visits to our affiliate websites, and to show you which
	    shows are most popular.</li>
	    <li><b>Functionality cookies</b> – These cookies save you
	    time. These cookies remember your user name and can also
	    be used to remember settings that you can customise. These
	    cookies allow us to remember choices you make
	    (e.g. whether you want to share your activity with others)
	    and provide enhanced, more personal features. They may
	    also be used to provide services you have asked for such
	    as watching a video or commenting. Without these cookies,
	    we won’t be able to distinguish you from other users and,
	    as a result, save you time.</li>
	    <li><b>Targeting or advertising cookies</b> – These
	    cookies make any advertising that you may see
	    relevant. These cookies are used to deliver adverts or
	    links more relevant to you and your interests. They are
	    also used to limit the number of times you see an ad as
	    well as help measure the effectiveness of ad
	    campaigns. They may be placed by us, or advertising
	    networks with our, or our affiliate’s, permission. Without
	    these cookies, you may still receive advertising – the
	    advertising, however, will be less relevant to you.</li>
	    <li><b>Third party cookies</b> – Our Products may allow
	    third parties to set cookies on your device. This means
	    that when we display content from a third party this third
	    party may set their own cookies or similar technologies
	    onto your device. We do not control the use of such
	    cookies and in many instances have no access to the data
	    collected by these third parties. Third party use of
	    cookies is subject to their respective privacy
	    policies.</li>
	  </ul>
