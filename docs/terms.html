	  <br><h1>TERMS OF USE</h1>
	  <p>Effective <b>10 January 2018</b><br>
	    Last modified on <b>10 January 2018</b></p><br>  
	  <h2>Hello! We are so chuffed to have you with us.</h2>
	  <p>These Terms (as defined in detail below) describe your
	 rights and responsibilities when using such of our website,
	 web applications, platform, services, community / developer
	 resources, and products as provided at <a class="a-link"
	 href="https://legalese.com" target="blank">legalese.com</a>
	 (each a "<b>Product</b>", and collectively, the
	 “<b>Products</b>”).</p>
	 <p>The Products are provided by Legalese Pte. Ltd. (also
	 referred to as “<b>Legalese</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>our</b>”
	 or “<b>us</b>”), a private limited company incorporated in Singapore with the unique entity
	 number 201527692R. As a company and as a project, we try hard to be international, <a class="a-link"
	 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar"
	 target="_blank">open source</a>, <a class="a-link"
	 href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/02/08/means-remote-first-company/"
	 target="_blank">remote-first</a>,
	 aspirationally <a class="a-link"

	 target="_blank">teal</a>, and <a class="a-link"
	 href="https://www.holacracy.org/how-it-works/"
	 target="_blank">(softly) holacratic</a>.</p><br>
 
	 <h2>First things first</h2>
	  <h3>What 'These Terms' include</h3>
	  <p><a class="footnote">This document <span>i.e. these Terms
	  of Use, as may be amended from time to time</span></a> is to be read and interpreted together
	  with, where applicable, our <a class="a-link"
	  href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and any additional
	  terms, policies, and requirements that we may provide from
	  time to time (all of which together with these Terms of Use,
	   collectively referred to as these
	    “<b>Terms</b>”).</p>
	  <h3>Navigating this document</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p><a class="footnote">Highted texts like this (go on, you
      can click it)<span>Good job, you clicked something.</span></a>
      are clickable –– when clicked, they display further information
      (they're a bit like footnotes), all of which are incorporated as
      part of these Terms.</li>
      <li>Capitalised terms not otherwise defined under
      these Terms will bear the same meaning
      as that ascribed to them under the <a class="a-link"
      href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> (as may be
      amended from time to time).</p></li></ul>
    
	  <h3>These Terms form part of a binding contract</h3>
	  <p>These Terms describe your rights and responsibilities,
	    and govern your access and use of any or all of the
	    Products, including any services or features we offer
	    through it.</p>
	  <p>We know it can be a bit of a chore (as these things
	    usually are), but please do read these Terms carefully as
	    your agreement to be bound by these Terms is a condition
	    for using or accessing any of the Products.</p>
	  <p><b>In fact, by using or accessing any of the Products,
	      you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms.</b></p>
	  <p>In other words, these Terms form a binding agreement
	    between you and Legalese.</p>
	  <p>If you are not eligible to use or access the Products
	    under these Terms, or if you do not agree to these Terms,
	    then you do not have our permission to use or access the
	    Products (or any part thereof).</p>
	  
	  <h3>'We' may include the extended team</h3>
	  <p>We may leverage our employees, contributors, third party
	  contractors, and such of those of our corporate affiliates
	  (all of whom together, the "<a class="footnote"><b>Extended
	  Team</b><span>We call them the Extended Team and not a
	  “family” because we read the HBR 2014 piece, <em>Your
	  Company Is Not A Family</em></span></a>") in exercising our
	  rights and performing our obligations, whether directly or
	  indirectly, in respect of the Products. While to the extent
	  reasonably practicable, we will be responsible for the
	  Extended Team’s compliance with our obligations under these
	  Terms, where we leverage the Extended Team (whether directly
	  or indirectly) in exercising our rights or performing our
	  obligations in respect of the Products, you acknowledge and
	  accept that these Terms shall extend to and cover the
	  Extended Team as applicable, and where applicable,
	  references to “<b>Legalese</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>our</b>”
	  or “<b>us</b>” in these Terms shall therefore also included the
	  Extended Team.

	  <h3>Who ‘you’ are</h3>
	  <p>You are the individual using and/or accessing the
	  Products.</p>
	      
	  <h4>If you're a representative</h4>
	  <p>You are also agreeing to these Terms on behalf of
	  whomever (whether individual, company, organisation, or
	  entity) you are accessing or using the Products for. As
	  such, please make sure that you have the necessary authority
	  to enter into and agree to these Terms on such  behalf before
	  proceeding.</p>

	  <h4>Corporate email domain</h4>
	  <p>If you are signed up for an account on the Products using
	  a corporate email domain, "<b>you</b>” means that entity
	  owning that corporate email domain used to sign up for an
	  account. This means that such entity is entitled to modify,
	  re-assign roles, or otherwise exercise any applicale rights
	  under these Terms.</p>

	  <br> 
	  <h2>Using the Products</h2>
	  <h4>Follow our instructions as intended, and no misconduct
	    or misuse please! </h4>
	  <p>Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with
	  these Terms, Legalese grants you limited, non-transferable,
	  non-sublicensable, revocable permission to access and/or use
	  the Products for your personal, internal use during the Term
	  at the level of service for which you have paid all
	  applicable fees.</p>
	  <p>You must ensure that you and anyone you give access to
	  and/or authorise to use the Products in your account
	  (“<b>Authorised Users</b>”) fully comply with these
	  Terms. We may review conduct for compliance purposes, but we
	  have no obligation to do so.</p>

	  <h3>General rules</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The Products are not intended for and should not be
	    used by anyone under the age of 18.</li>
	    <li>You and your Authorised Users must follow any policies
	    made available to you within or via the Products.</li>
	    <li>You and your Authorised Users must not misuse our
	    Products.<br><em>For example, you and your Authorised
	    Users must not interfere with the Products (or our
	    provision of them), interfere with or circumvent any
	    feature of the Product(s), and further must not try
	    accessing them using a method other than via the interface
	    and instructions that we provide. This includes any
	    technological measures we employ to enforce these
	    Terms.</em></li>
	    <li>You and your Authorised Users must not use our
	    Products where it is prohibited by laws applicable
	    (whether to you or us), including any export and re-export
	    control laws and regulations that may apply.</li>
	    <li>You and your Authorised Users must not use the
	    Products in a way that infringes anyone’s rights.</li>
	    <li>Using the Products does not give you or your
	    Authorised Users any ownership of any intellectual
	    property rights in the Products or any content or features
	      accessed therein.</li>
	    <li>You will also keep your billing and
	  contact information current at all times by notifying
	      Legalese of any changes.</li>
	  </ul>

 	  <h3>Non-Legalese Stuff</h3>
	  <p>Our Products may from time to time include platforms that
	  third parties may use to develop applications and software
	  that complement the use of the Product(s), or content
	  sourced from third parties that we have no legal
	  relationship with or have no control over (“<b>Non-Legalese
	  Stuff</b>”). Non-Legalese Stuff are not the Products, and we
	  do not warrant or support them. Ultimately, it is up to you
	  (not us) that decides whether or not to use them or heed
	  them.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Beta Products</h3>
	  <p>Occasionally, we may release Product(s) and features on a
	  alpha, beta, seed, and other pre-release basis, and related
	  documentation, materials, and information (collectively, the
	    "<b>Beta Products</b>".</p>
	  <p>Beta Products will be identified as “<em>beta</em>” or
	  “<em>pre-release</em>”, or with words or phrases importing
	    similar meanings.</p>
	  <p>Beta Products are not ready for prime time, and any
	  warranties or contractual commitments that we may make for
	    other Products do not apply.</p>
	  <p>We expect Beta Products to contain defects and bugs. Beta
	  Products are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis
	  for the sole purpose of providing Legalese with feedback on
	  quality, usability, performance, and the idenitification of
	    defects.</p>

	  <br>
  	  <h2>Modifying Products</h2>
	  <p>We are constantly changing and improving. We may add or
	  remove functionalities, features, or even entire Product(s)
	  altogether. We may also stop providing Products to you, or
	  add or create new limits to our Product(s) at any time. We
	  also reserve the right to charge for any of our Product(s),
	  features, or functionalities at any time.</p>
	  <p>Subject to these Terms and any payment obligations you
	  may have already incurred, you can stop using the Products
	  at any time, although we’d be rather sorry to see you
	  go.</p>

	<br>  <h2>Send us feedback</h2>
	  <p>We welcome feedback. When you send us feedback or
	  suggestions regarding us or any of the Products, there is a
	  chance that we will use it. Please note that if you send us
	  any feedback or suggestions, they will likely not be kept
	  confidential. Along with any feedback or suggestions, you
	  also grant us (for Legalese, and all of our users,
	  customers, or any personnel of ours) an unlimited,
	  unrestricted, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual,
	  sublicensable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, transferable,
	  royalty-free right to use and exploit any such feedback or
	  suggestions for any purpose without any obligation or
	  compensation to you. However, if we for whatever reason
	  choose not to implement a suggestion or feedback, please
	  know that we appreciate it nonetheless.</p>
	   
	  <br>
	  <h2>User Data</h2>
	  <p>You or your Authorised Users may upload, submit, store,
	  send or receive content or information (including any
	  confidential company or personal data) as part of your use
	  and/or access of the Products (“<b>User Data</b>”) and you
	  may exclusively provide us with instructions (at the time of
	  disclosure) on what to do with it.<br><em>For example, you
	  may provision or deprovision access to the Products, enable
	  or disable third party integrations, manage permissions,
	  retention, and export settings, transfer or assign
	  Authorised Users, share information with external parties,
	  consolidate information, etc.</em><br>Since these choices by
	  and instructions from you and/or your Authorised Users may
	  result in the access, use, disclosure, modification, or
	  deletion of certain or all User Data, please consider your
	  instructions carefully and be familiar with
	  our <a class="a-link" href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy
	  Policy</a>.</p>

	  <h3>Your responsibilities</h3>
	  <p>It is your responsibility to (a) inform all Authorised
	  Users of your own policies and practices, and applicable
	  laws and/or regulations that are relevant to their use of
	  the Products, and of any settings and interaction that may
	  impact the processing of User Data; and (b) obtain all
	  rights, permissions, or consents from Authorised Users or
	  such other persons that are necessary to grant the rights
	  and licenses under these Terms and for the lawful use and
	  transmission of User Data and the operation and use of the
	    Products.</p>

	  <h3>How we treat User Data</h3>
	  <p>Your User Data is uploaded and downloaded over a secure
	  connection, your credentials are encrypted and hashed. We
	  don’t store (or even know) your password. Your User Data is
	  stored securely, and only people you’ve given express
	  account access to can access your User Data (and even then,
	  only to the extent of the access permissions set by you
	  under your account). We expect you to ensure that your team,
	  particularly those you give Admin access to, have strong and
	  unqiue passwords.</p>
	  <p>For more information about how we treat your User Data,
	  and also other kinds of data we collect, read our <a class="a-link" href="privacy.html"
	  target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
	  
	  <p>We think it’s pretty common sense but we’ll say it
	  anyway: if we, in our sole and absolute discretion,
	  determine that you have acted inappropriately, we reserve
	  the right to take down User Data, terminate your account,
	  prohibit you from using the Products, and take any legal action
	    that we may deem fit.</p>

  	  <h3>Protecting User Data</h3>
	  <p>The protection of User Data is a top priority for us.
	  We will strive to  maintain administrative, physical, and technical
	  safeguards at a level not materially less protective than our own Security Policy. Those safeguards
	  will include measures for preventing unauthorized access,
	  use, modification, deletion and disclosure of User Data by
	  our personnel. Before sharing User Data with any of our
	  third party service providers, we will ensure that the third
	  party maintains, at a minimum, reasonable data practices for
	  maintaining the confidentiality and security of User Data
	    and preventing unauthorized access.</p>
	  <p>However, ultimately, you (not us) bear sole
	  responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup
	  of User Data when in your or your representatives’ or
	  agents’ possession or control or when you choose to use
	  unencrypted gateways (e.g., IRC/XMPP clients) to connect to
	  the Products. We are not responsible for what your
	  Authorised Users do with User
	  Data; that is your responsibility.</p>

	  <br>
	  <h2>Ownership of information & proprietary rights</h2>
	  <h3>General rule</h3>
	  <p>You are prohibited from using proprietary content from or in
	  the Products for purposes other than that which they have been
	  provided for under the Products, unless you have obtained
	  the requisite permission from its owner.</p>

	  <h3>What’s yours is yours</h3>
	  <p>As between us on one hand, and you and your Authorised
	  Users on the other, you will retain ownership of any
	  intellectual property rights that you hold in User Data, and
	  all confidentiality rights in confidential data.</p>
	  <p>Subject to these Terms, you (for yourself and all of your
	  Authorised Users) grant us and the Extended Team, a
	  worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, limited license to
	  access, use, host, encode, store, reproduce, process,
	  modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting
	  from translations, adaptations, or other changes we make so
	  that your User Data works better with the Products),
	  distribute, communicate, export, publish, publicly perform,
	  and display User Data, and any Non-Legalese Stuff created by
	  or for you, only as reasonably necessary (a) to provide,
	  maintain, operate, promote, or improve the Products (or to
	  develop new ones); (b) to prevent or address service,
	  security, product, support, or technical issues in any of
	  the Products; and (c) as required by applicable law and/or
	  regulations, or as permitted by our <a class="a-link"
	  href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. You
	  represent and warrant to us that you have secured all rights
	  in and to User Data from your Authorised Users as may be
	  necessary to submit User Data and grant this license. This
	  license continues even if you stop using the Products,
	  although some Products may offer you ways to access, remove,
	  or limit the use of User Data that you had provided.</p>
	  <p>You also agree to indemnify, release, and hold us
	  harmless from all liability, claims, actions, loss, harm,
	  damage, injury, cost, or expense arising out of any User
	  Data.</p>
	  <p>We may also employ automated systems to analyse your User
	  Data to provide you personally relevant Product
	  features.</p>

	  <h3>What’s others’ is theirs</h3>
	  <p>The Products may from time to time display content that
	  is not ours. Such content remains their rightful owners'. For the avoidance
	  of doubt, we make no representations, warranties, or
	  endorsements as to the accuracy, completeness, relevance, or
	  truth of such content. Accordingly, we cannot be held
	  liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss or damage you
	  suffer in connection with any content that is not
	    ours.</p>
	  
	  <h3>What’s ours is ours</h3>
	  <p>Using the Products does not give you ownership or any
	  proprietary or intellectual property rights in the Products
	    or the content that you access.

	  <h3>Other restrictions</h3>
	  <p>These Terms also do not grant you the right to use any
	  branding or logos used in the Products. You are also
	  prohibited from removing, obscuring, or altering any notices
	  or disclaimers displayed in or along with the Products.</p>
	  <p>As an open source company, open source software is even
	   more important to us. Some software used in our products
	   may be offered under an open source license that we will
	   make available to you. There may be provisions in the open
	   source license that expressly oveerride some of these
	   Terms, in such event, the express terms of such open source
	   licenses that override these Terms will prevail (but only
	   to the extent applicable to the open source content and/or
	   elements to which they relate).</p>

	  <br>
	  <h2>Privacy & copyright protection</h2>
	  <p>Our <a class="a-link" href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy
	  Policy</a> explains how we treat information, your personal data and
	  protect your privacy when you use the Products. By using the
	  Products, you agree that we can use such data in accordance
	  with our privacy policies.</p>
	  <p>We may choose to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement.</p>
	  <p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect you to do the same.</p>
	  <p>If you have an intellectual-property rights related
	  complaint about material posted on or distributed through the Products, please
	  write to us at <a class="a-link"
	  href="mailto:support@legalese.com?subject=IP right
		complaint&CC=clause@legalese.com">support@legalese.com</a> and include the following information:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>an electronic or physical signature of the person
	    authorised to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright
	    or other right being infringed;</li>
	    <li>a description of the copyrighted work or other
	      intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;</li>
	   <li>a description of the material that you claim is
	     infringing and where it is located on the Product;</li>
	    <li>your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
	    <li> a statement by you that you have a good faith belief
  that the use of the materials on the Product of which you are
  complaining is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or
  the law; and </li>
	   <li>a statement by you that the above information in your
  notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the
  copyright or intellectual property owner or authorised to act on the
  copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <br>
	  <h2>Your purchasing decisions</h2>
	  <p>We may from time to time share information about our
	  future products, plans, features, and functionalities
	  (“<b>Possible Futures</b>”) because we relish the
	  transparency and openness. However, please do not rely on
	  our public statements about any Possible Futures when making
	  a commitment or purchase with us. Should you decide to buy
	  the Products or pay for any of them, that decision should be
	  based on the functionalities or features that we have made
	  available today and not on any expectation of delivery of
	  any Possible Futures. Please take us as we are.</p>

	  <br>
	  <h2>Your payment obligations (if any)</h2>
	  <h3>Payment terms</h3>
	  <p>Fees and payment obligations for any of the Products may
	  be set out to you in the user interface, as
	  appropriate. Payment obligations are non-cancellable and,
	  except as expressly stated by us in written terms, fees paid
	  are non-refundable.</p>
	  <p>For clarity, in the event that you downgrade any subscriptions
	  from a paid plan to a free plan, you will remain responsible
	  for any unpaid fees already accrued under the paid plan, and Products under
	  the paid plan will be deemed fully performed and delivered
	  upon expiration of the initial paid plan subscription
	    term.</p>
	  
	  <p>If we agree to invoice you by email, full payment must be
	  received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. Fees
	  are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or
	  similar governmental assessments of any nature, including,
	  for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes,
	  assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively,
	  “<b>Taxes</b>”). You will be responsible for paying all
	  Taxes associated with its purchases, except for those taxes
	    based on our net income.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Credits</h3>
	  <p>Any credits that may accrue to your account (for example,
	  from a promotion or given by us at our sole and absolute
	  discretion), will expire following the expiration date as
	  applicable (usually made known at the same time as when the
	  credit was first made known to you), will have no currency or
	  exchange value, and will not be transferable or
	  refundable. Credits accrued to a team on a free subscription
	  plan will expire if the team’s plan is not upgraded to a
	  paid plan within one-hundred and eighty (180) days of
	  accrual.</p>

	  <br>
	  <h2>Our responsibilities</h2>
	  <h3>Providing the Products</h3>
	  <p>You’re not the only one with responsibilities; we have
	  some, too.<br>We will, subject to these Terms, use our best
	  efforts to (a) make the Product(s) available.</p>
	  <p>Be assured that unless arising out of
	  the <em>Non-Legalese Stuff</em> section, due to any breach
	  of these Terms on your part, or circumstances not within our
	  control, we will use our best efforts to not materially
	  decrease the functionality of the Product(s) during your
	  applicable subscription term. For any breach of a warranty
	  in this section, your exclusive remedies are those described
	  in these Terms, and your payments or subscription terms, as relevant.</p>
	  <h3>Keeping the Products available</h3>
	  <p>For some of the Products (excluding Beta Products), we may offer specific uptime
	  commitments paired with credits for the event if we fall
	  short. In those cases, the credits will serve as what the
	  lawyers call ‘liquidated damages’ and will be your sole
	  remedy for the downtime and related inconvenience. For all
	  Products (excluding Beta Products), we will use commercially
	  reasonable efforts to make them available 24 hours a day, 7
	  days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned
	  downtime to be infrequent but will endeavor to provide you
	  with advance notice (e.g., through the relevant Product(s)),
	  if we think it may exceed thirty (30) continuous minutes.</p>

  	  <br>
	  <h2>Electronic communications</h2>
	  <p>When you use the Products or send communications to us
	  via any of the Products, you are communicating with us
	  electronically. You also consent to receive electronically
	  any communications related to your use of the Products. We
	  may communicate with you by email or by posting notices on
	  the Product. You agree that all agreements, notices,
	  disclosures and other communications that are provided to
	  you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
	  communications be in writing. All notices from us intended
	  for receipt by you shall be deemed delivered and effective
	  when sent to the email address you provide to us. Please
	  note that by submitting User Data, creating a user account
	  or otherwise providing us with your email address, postal
	  address or phone number, you are agreeing that we or our
	  agents may contact you at that address or number in a manner
	  consistent with our <a class="a-link"
	  href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

	  <br>
	  <h2>Warranties & disclaimers</h2>
	  <p>We provide the Products (save for the Beta Products,
	  which are provided on a much lower, diminished, and
	  compromised standard) using a commercially reasonable level
	  of skill and care as that expected of service providers, and
	  we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are
	  certain things that we don’t and cannot promise about the
	  Products.</p>
	  <h3>We are not lawyers, legal, tax or financial advisers</h3>
	  <p>We provide information and access to industry standards,
	  received industry advice, open-source, third party and
	  proprietary documents and tutorials, templated forms,
	  analytics and data, team administration and networking
	  functionality, cap table modelling, value-added document-related
	  services, and additional features to assist with the
	  completion of tasks and workflows relating to you, your company
	  and/or its administration.</p>
	  <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for the
	  appropriate use of any documents, instructions, tutorials or
	  data downloaded, obtained from, or otherwise sourced in whole
	  or in part from us or the Products. In particular you agree that:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Legalese is not providing legal, financial, tax, investment
	    brokerage or any other advice. The Products should not be
	    used as a substitute for advice from qualified legal, tax
	    or accounting professionals.</li>
	    <li>The documents available via the Products may not fit
	    your specific circumstances. You should make your own
	    judgement on the suitability of any such materials to your
	    circumstances, or obtain your own legal advice to review
	    such materials before using them.</li>
	    <li>Legalese cannot and does not provide any assurance or
	    guarantee that any documents provided via the Products are
	    suitable, sufficient, correct, or appropriate for the use to which
	    you put them.</li>
	    <li>Legalese is excluded from all legal responsibility
	    and/or costs for reliance placed by anyone on the
	    Products, or any information, documents, or logic obtained
	    therefrom.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h3>No specific promises</h3>
	  <p>Save where expressly set out in these Terms or additional
	  terms that you may have with us, neither Legalese nor its
	  Extended Team, makes any specific promises about the
	  Products or any part thereof. For example, we don’t make any
	  commitments about the content within the Products, the
	  specific function of the Product(s), or their reliability,
	  enforceability, availability, correctness, fitness for any
	  particular purpose, or their ability to meet your needs. The
	  Products are provided on an as-is and as-available
	    basis.</p>
	  <h3>No implied terms</h3>
	  <p>Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like
	  the implied warranties of merchantability, title, fitness
	  for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. To the
	  extent permitted by applicable law, we hereby exclude all
	  warranties.  You further acknowledge and accept that we do
	  not warrant that the Products will be uninterrupted, timely,
	  secure, or error-free.</p>

	  <h3>Liability</h3>
	  <p>To the extent not prohibited by applicable law and/or
	  regulations, Legalese and its Extended Team will not be
	  responsible for any lost profits, revenues, investment,
	  data, financial losses, opportunity costs, direct damages
	  (i.e. damages that one would reasonable expect to arise from
	  any breach in question, without taking into account any
	  special circumstances of the non-breaching party),
	  incidental damages (i.e. expenses incurred by the
	  non-breaching party in connection with its rejection of the
	  Products, or by the non-breaching Party in connection with
	  an alleged breach), consequential damages (i.e. losses
	  sustained by the non-breaching party that are attributable
	  to any special circumstances of such party that the
	  allegedly breaching party was aware of when the
	  non-breaching party used the relevant Product(s)), exemplary
	  or punitive damages.</p>
	  <p>Other than in connection with a party’s indemnification
	  obligations hereunder, in no event will either Legalese or
	  the Extended Team’s aggregate liability arising out of or
	  related to the Terms or any other applicable terms (whether
	  in contract or tort or under any other theory of liability)
	  exceed the total amount paid by you in respect of the
	  relevant subscription and/or Product in the twelve (12)
	  months preceding the last event giving rise to
	  the alleged liability. The foregoing will not limit your payment
	  obligations set out in these Terms or any other applicable
	  terms.</p>
	  <p>You are responsible for all login credentials, including
	  usernames and passwords, for administrator accounts as well
	  the accounts of your Authorised Users. We will not be
	  responsible for any damages, losses or liability to you,
	  Authorised Users, or anyone else, if such information is not
	  kept confidential by you or your Authorised Users, or if
	  such information is correctly provided by an unauthorized
	  third party logging into and accessing the services.</p>
	  <p>The limitations under this Liability section applies with
	  respect to all legal theories, whether in contract, tort or
	  otherwise, and to the extent permitted by law. The
	  provisions of this Liability section allocate the risks
	  between the parties under these Terms, and the parties have
	  relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter
	  into a contract for Products, subscriptions, and the pricing
	  for the Products (or any part thereof).</p>
	   <p>You agree, to the extent not prohibited by applicable
	  law, to hold harmless and indemnify Legalese and the Extended
	  Team, including each of Legalese’s and the Extended Team’s
	  affiliates, officers, agents, contractors, and employees
	  from any claim, suit, or action arising from or related to
	  the use of the Products or violation of these Terms,
	  including any liability or expense arising from claims,
	  losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs, and
	  attorneys’ fees.</p>

	  <br>

	  <h2>Termination</h2>
	  <h3>Termination for cause</h3>
	  <p>Either of us may terminate these Terms on notice to the
	  other party if the other party materially breaches these Terms
	  and such breach (provided that such breach is capable of
	  being corrected) is not cured within thirty (30) days after
	  the non-breaching party provides notice of the breach.</p>
	  <p>You are fully responsible for your Authorised Users,
	  including for any breaches of these Terms caused by your
	  Authorized Users. We may terminate these Terms or any
	  relationship with you immediately on notice to you if we
	  reasonably believe that the Products are being used by you
	  or your Authorised Users in violation of applicable law.</p>

	  unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Term of those
	  subscriptions after the effective date of termination. In no

	  pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the
	    effective date of termination.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h2>Data portability & deletion</h2>
	  <p>During your use of the Product or during the term of a
	  subscription with us, you may be permitted to export or
	  share certain User Data from the Products; provided, however,
	  that because we have different products with varying
	  features and you have different retention options, you
	  acknowledge and agree that the ability to export or share
	  User Data may be limited or unavailable depending on the
	  type of Product plan in effect and the data retention,
	  sharing or invite settings enabled. Following termination or
	  expiration of your subscription, we will have no obligation
	  to maintain or provide any User Data and may thereafter,
	  unless legally prohibited, delete all User Data in our
	  systems or otherwise in our possession or under our
	  control.</p>


	  <br>
	  <h2>Publicity</h2>
	  <p>You grant us the right to use your company name and logo
	  as a reference for marketing or promotional purposes on our
	  website and in other public or private communications with
	  our existing or potential customers, subject to your
	  standard trademark usage guidelines as provided to us from
	  time-to-time. We definitely don’t want to list customers who
	  don’t want to be listed, so if you wish to remain uncited,

	  <br>
	  <h2>About these Terms</h2>
	  <br><h4>Force Majeure</h4>
	  <p>Neither of us will be liable by reason of any failure or
	  delay in the performance of its obligations on account of
	  events beyond the reasonable control of a party, which may
	  include denial-of-service attacks, a failure by a third
	  party hosting provider or utility provider, strikes,
	  shortages, riots, fires, acts of god, war, terrorism, and
	    governmental action.</p>
	  <br><h4>Modifications</h4>
	  <p>We may modify these Terms or any additional terms that
	  apply to the Products to, for example, reflect changes to
	  the law or changes to the Products. You should look at these
	  Terms regularly as we will post notice of modifications to
	  these Terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified
	  additional terms in the applicable Product(s). Changes will
	  not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner
	  than fourteen days after they are posted, but where such
	  changes address new functions for a Product or are made for
	  legal reasons, such changes shall be effective
	  immediately. If you do not agree to any modified terms, you
	  must discontinue your use and access of the Products immediately.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h4>Governing law & dispute resolution</h4>
	  <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance
	  with the laws of the Republic of Singapore without regard to
	  the principles of conflict of laws. In relation to any legal
	  action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with
	  these Terms (including the validity of these Terms), you and
	  Legalese hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
	  the Courts of the Republic of Singapore.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h4>Precedence</h4>
	  <p>If there is a conflict between these Terms and the
	  additional terms, the additional terms shall prevail to the
	  extent that any such conflict occurs.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h4>Severance</h4>
	  <p>If any provision of these Terms or part thereof is
	  rendered void, illegal, or unenforceable by any applicable
	  laws and/or regulations to which it is subject, it shall be
	  rendered void, illegal, or unenforceable to that extent and
	  no further.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h4>No third party beneficiaries</h4>
	  <p>These Terms control the relationship between Legalese and
	  you, and do not create any third party beneficiary
	  rights. The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act
	  (Cap. 53B) of Singapore (and any statutory equivalent where applicable) shall
	  not under any circumstances apply to these Terms, and any
	  person who is not a party to these Terms (whether or not
	  such person shall be named, referred to, or otherwise
	  identified, or form part of a class of persons so named,
	  referred to or identified, in these Terms) shall have no
	  right whatsoever under the Contracts (Rights of Third
	  Parties) Act (Cap. 53B) of Singapore to enforce these Terms
	  or any of its provisions.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h4>Assignment</h4>
	  <p>You shall
	  not assign or delegate any of your rights or obligations
	  under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without
	  our prior written consent.</p>
	  <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing in this <em>Assignment</em>
	  section, either of us may assign these Terms in its
	  entirety, without consent of the other party, to a corporate
	  affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition,
	  corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially
	  all of its assets. Any purported assignment in
	  violation of this section is void. A party’s sole remedy for
	  any purported assignment by the other party in breach of
	    this section on <em> Assignment</em> will be, at the non-assigning party’s election,
	  termination of these Terms upon written notice to the
	  assigning party. In the event of such a termination by you,
	  we will refund you any prepaid fees covering the remainder
	  of the relevant Term of all subscriptions after the effective date of
	  termination. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind
	  and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective
	    successors and permitted assigns.</p>
	  
	  <br><h4>Non-waiver</h4>
	  <p>If you do not comply with these Terms, and we don’t take
	  action right away, this does not mean that we are giving up
	  any rights that we may have, and this will not preclude us
	  from taking any action in the future. Any single or partial
	  exercise of any right under these Terms shall also not
	  preclude any other or further exercise of it.</p>
