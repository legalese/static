    	      <p>Because few lawyers have the coding skills to draft
    	      their own smart contracts, computer programmers would
    	      play a larger role, creating new liability questions for
    	      faulty algorithms and even ethical issues regarding the
    	      practice of law by non-lawyers. Conceivably, smart
    	      contracts could reduce some legal cost around contract
    	      execution and dispute resolution by making execution
    	      automatic. However, legal cost could shift from
    	      execution to the drafting phase. As Houman Shadab, a
    	      professor at New York Law School, has pointed out:
    	      </p>
    	      <p><em>By requiring parties to strictly commit, at the

    	      transactional attorneys and others to structure smart
    	      contractual relationships may increase. Parties would
    	      most likely want to specify a more detailed range of
    	      contingencies and outcomes ahead of time before
    	      committing themselves to abide by the decisions of a

<h2 class="lower-nav-el" id="biz-challenge">The Business Challenge</h2>
          <p>Very clever people have thought long and hard about a world in which computers execute contracts, where programs transfer money to people and people transfer money to programs, where decentralized cryptocurrencies disrupt banks and financial institutions. Very clever people will be involved in the effort to build a bridge between formal and natural languages. Many man-years will go into developing a Github/Wikipedia of legal templates that are freely available for all to use.</p>
          <p>Legalese is clever in a different way. The business challenge of getting from the 20th-century status quo to the 21st-century promised land requires the ability to scout and climb a monotonically increasing path through multidimensional “value-proposition” space toward the global optimax. This is as much a logistical and business challenge as a computational linguistics challenge. That’s why we’ve chosen to start with spreadsheets: we optimize for the power user while building a painless onboarding pathway for first-timers.</p>
          <p>You know how some extreme runners run fifty marathons in fifty consecutive days? Actually running the marathons is one kind of challenge. Arranging the flights, travel, and accommodation so the runner gets from finish line in one city to starting line in another, is a different kind of challenge. Developing a domain-specific language, or a library in which to model contracts, is the former kind of challenge. Making Legalese succeed as a business is the latter kind.</p>

          <p>Text planning and interaction effects are critical to contract generation. One part of a contract may affect another. Sometimes these interactions are simple, and can be represented by a DAG. Sometimes these interactions are, superficially and conventionally, cyclic, and need to be decomposed with some clarity. Metaprogramming helps to correctly represent these interactions. <a class="a-link" href="http://www.cogentex.com/research/index.html" target="_blank">CoGenText</a> is an example of an NLG company. See also <a class="a-link" href="http://remu.grammaticalframework.org/" target="_blank">GrammaticalFramework</a> and <a class="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempto_Controlled_English" target="_blank">Attempto English</a>.</p>
          <h3 class="lower-nav-el" id="social-agile">Social Implications of Natural Contracts</h3>
          <p>(Written as a response to a <a class="a-link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13448195" target="_blank">thread</a> on HN)</p>
          <p>Today’s model of contracting is fire-and-regret: spec out as much as you can of the next five or ten years, and when the world changes, litigate. That’s not very agile. And unfortunately for the non-agiles, Hart and Holstrom won the 2016 Nobel in Economics for <a class="a-link" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2016/10/science-deal" target="_blank">pointing out the futility of the idea of a complete contract</a>.</p>
          <p>What’s the alternative? Hirschman remarked that your <a class="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty" target="_blank">voice sounds loudest when you are closest to exit</a>. What if every contract had a maximum term of one year, one month, one day? What if we treated contracts as an iterated stream instead of an immutable invariant? For example, think about how “no-contract” phone plans have made the telco market more competitive, to the benefit of the consumer. Power imbalances might be reduced precisely because nobody’s locked in: it’s a lot easier to break up when you’re just dating. After the marriage you might let yourself go.</p>
          <p>Software is eating law, but “law is code” is only the first step. Just as the historic transition from proprietary to opensource informs ideas like “Github for law”, the historic transition from waterfall to agile will find its analog in the legal and business domains by changing the way we develop and deploy contracts, ultimately driving changes in economic relations.</p>
          <p>Think about how agile development means less software project failure, and less software project failure means less litigation between client and outsourced development vendor. That’s just one example. If better tools and languages mean that we can better transform our intent into specification, we might be forced to be clearer about what we actually do and don’t agree on, we might be more honest in our dealings, there might be an actual “meeting of minds”, and when things don’t turn out the way we expect, rather than blaming the other party, which seems dysfunctional, we embrace change together, and agree to consciously work on the relationship, to improve the next iteration of the contract … which is due to be revised and renewed anyway, next month, not next decade.</p>

    	      <p>Amber fast-forwards through the dynamic chunks of the README—boring legal UML diagrams, mostly—soaking up the gist of the plan. Yemen is one of the few countries to implement traditional Sunni shari'a law and a limited liability company scam at the same time. Owning slaves is legal—the fiction is that the owner has an option hedged on the indentured laborer's future output, with interest payments that grow faster than the unfortunate victim can pay them off—and companies are legal entities. If Amber sells herself into slavery to this company, she will become a slave and the company will be legally liable for her actions and upkeep. The rest of the legal instrument—about ninety percent of it, in fact—is a set of self-modifying corporate mechanisms coded in a variety of jurisdictions that permit Turing-complete company constitutions, and which act as an ownership shell for the slavery contract. At the far end of the corporate shell game is a trust fund of which Amber is the prime beneficiary and shareholder. When she reaches the age of majority, she'll acquire total control over all the companies in the network and can dissolve her slave contract; until then, the trust fund (which she essentially owns) oversees the company that owns her (and keeps it safe from hostile takeover bids). Oh, and the company network is primed by an extraordinary general meeting that instructed it to move the trust's assets to Paris immediately. A one-way airline ticket is enclosed.</em>
